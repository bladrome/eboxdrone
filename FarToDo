TIMER:
		LOOP TIME is a severe problem, 50? 100? 200? 

RC:
		More precise measurement is necessary.
		Restruct it if sth is terrible.

		Function constrain() and map() are better than casual casts.

PID:
		Simulation with more modules is a good way to test itself.

MOTORS:
		Function constrain() and map() are better than casual casts.
		Battery's compensation need more tests.

LOG:
		Find a reliable flash address.

LED:
		Patterns of flasher could be more comfortable.

FILTER:
		Compensating filter and Kalman filter is more attrctive and feasiblle.


OTHERS:
		Pondering...
